# EG1311 â€” Design and Make Project

## Project Aim
The aim of this project is to design a self-powered robot capable of navigating a complex
obstacle course, consisting of a starting area, a bump, a ramp, and a wall. Additionally, the
robot must successfully deliver a ping-pong ball over the wall (see Fig. 1).

## Project Constraints
There are five constraints that were imposed for the project:
- The robot must fit within a 30 x 30 x 30 cm cubic cage at the start.
- The robot must be made using only the materials that are provided.
- The team may not interact with the robot after it leaves the starting area.
- The team may not attach anything to the ping pong ball.
- The robot has up to 30 seconds to complete the course.
